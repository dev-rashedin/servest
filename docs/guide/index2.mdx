## Overview

`Servest` is a backend project scaffolding and addon generator built to make backend development fast, consistent, and framework-agnostic.

It helps you create production-ready backend templates — powered by Express.js (and soon other runtimes like Go, Python, and PHP).

Servest consists of two main parts:

- **create-servest** — The CLI tool used to scaffold new backend projects instantly.
- **servest (addons)** — A powerful extension system that lets you generate new modules, middleware, and integrations (like authentication, databases, and utilities) inside your existing project.

Together, they provide a _Vite-like_ developer experience — but for backend frameworks.

You can think of Servest as:

> create-vite + shadcn, but for backend frameworks.

Whether you’re building a simple API or a complex modular architecture, Servest ensures your project starts with clean, modern conventions and can grow with you.

You can learn more about specific addons in the [Addons Guide](/addons).

## Scaffolding Your First Servest Project

```bash
{
  "npm": "npm create servest@latest",
  "yarn": "yarn create servest",
  "pnpm": "pnpm create servest",
  "bun": "bun create servest",
  "deno": "deno init --npm servest",
}
```

Then follow the prompts to select your preferred template.

### Example: Create an Express MVC (TypeScript) Project

      npm create servest@latest servest-project -- --template express-mvc-ts -a f-auth f-articles mongoose eslint-prettier

This command:

- Creates a new Express MVC + TypeScript project
- Installs pre-configured dependencies
- Generates authentication, article routes, Mongoose, and ESLint + Prettier setup instantly

## Template Types

Currently available templates (Node.js + Express):

| Template Name     | Description                    |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------- |
| express-basic     | Minimal Express setup          |
| express-basic-ts  | Express + TypeScript setup     |
| express-api       | REST API structure             |
| express-api-ts    | REST API + TypeScript          |
| express-mvc       | MVC folder pattern             |
| express-mvc-ts    | MVC + TypeScript               |
| express-router    | Router-based project structure |
| express-router-ts | Router-based + TypeScript      |

_(More runtimes like Django, Go, and PHP will be supported soon.)_

## Manual Installation

      # npm
      npm install -D servest

      # yarn
      yarn add -D servest

      # pnpm
      pnpm add -D servest

      # bun
      bun add -D servest

Then you can run the Servest CLI inside your project:

      npx servest add f-auth

That will generate the full authentication feature with routes, controller, and service pre-configured.

---

## Command Line Interface

Once installed, Servest provides two primary CLIs:

| Command        | Description                                   |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| create-servest | Scaffold new backend projects                 |
| servest        | Add or remove addons, utilities, and features |

### Example Commands

      # Create new project
      npm create servest@latest my-api -- --template express-api-ts

      # Add Mongoose addon
      npx servest add mongoose

      # Add Auth + ESLint + Prettier
      npx servest add f-auth eslint-prettier

Run `npx servest --help` for a full list of available commands.

---

## Node.js Compatibility

Servest requires **Node.js 18+** (tested on 20.x and 22.x).  
 Some addons may require a higher version depending on dependencies.

> 💡 Make sure your Node version supports ES modules and import.meta syntax.
