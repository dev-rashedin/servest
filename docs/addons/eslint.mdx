# ESLint Addon

The `ESLint` addon in **Servest** sets up linting for your project to help you maintain a consistent and error-free codebase.

It automatically installs recommended dependencies, creates configuration files, and updates your scripts.

---

## How It Works

When you run:

```bash
npx servest@latest add eslint
```

Servest will:

1. **Check the framework**  
   Ensures your project uses a supported Node.js framework. If not, the operation is canceled.

2. Detect whether your project uses **JavaScript** or **TypeScript**, and accordingly names the generated files with `.js` or `.ts`.

3. **Install the Prettier package** using your selected package manager (`npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, or `bun`).

   Packages installed (with versions):
   - `eslint@9.34.0`
   - `globals@16.3.0`
   - `@eslint/js@9.34.0`
   - `typescript-eslint@8.41.0` (only if project language is TypeScript)

4. **Create ESLint configuration**
   - Generates `.eslintrc.js` or `.eslintrc.ts` depending on your language.
   - Adds recommended rules and presets.

5. **Update `package.json` scripts**  
   Adds or preserves the following scripts:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "lint": "eslint .",
     "lint:fix": "eslint . --fix"
   }
   ```

## Example

After adding ESLint in a TypeScript MVC project:

```bash
src/app/
  controllers/
  models/
  routes/
.eslintrc.ts
package.json (lint scripts added)
```

This gives you a ready-to-use linting setup without manually installing packages or creating config files.

---

## Notes

- ESLint can be safely re-run — existing configurations and scripts are preserved.
- Works seamlessly with the [Prettier Addon](./prettier) for combined linting and formatting workflows.
- **Confirmation Messages**:
  - ✅ Shows when configuration and scripts are successfully added.
  - 👍 Appears if ESLint is already installed.
  - 🎉 Confirms successful setup.

## Why It Matters

- **Consistency** → ensures coding standards are followed across the project.
- **Error prevention** → detects potential bugs before runtime.
- **Integration-friendly** → works well with other Servest addons like Prettier and lint-staged.
- **Safe to re-run** → won’t overwrite existing setup, avoiding accidental data loss.
