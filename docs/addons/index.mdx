# Addons

**Servest Addons** allow you to quickly enhance your project with utilities, integrations, or pre-configured setups. Addons are framework- and runtime-agnostic, meaning they can work across Node.js frameworks like Express, Fastify, NestJS, and future runtimes like Bun, Python, PHP, or Go.

---

## How Addons Work

### Scaffold a New Project:

```bash
npx create-servest@latest my-backend-app -- --template <templateName>
cd my-backend-app
```

> You can also add servest addons in your existing backend projects.

### Initialize Servest:

```bash
npx servest@latest init
```

### Add One or Multiple Addons:

```bash
npx servest@latest add <feature>

# Example:
npx servest@latest add f-auth
npx servest@latest add mongoose

# Multiple addons in one command:
npx servest@latest add eslint prettier prisma
```

## How Addons Affect Your Project

- Updates your **project structure** (MVC or modular) automatically.
- Installs all required **dependencies** and scripts.
- Keeps your setup **consistent** across projects.
- Ensures addons work **together without conflict**.

---

## Framework-Specific Addons

Currently, **Express** is the only supported framework.  
Future releases will include support for:

- Node.js frameworks → NestJS, Fastify, Koa
- Python → Django, FastAPI
- PHP → Laravel
- Go (planned)

Each framework will have its own section under `/addons/`.

---

## Notes

- Addons can be safely re-run; existing configurations will be skipped without overwriting your setup.
- Works seamlessly with other addons (e.g., ESLint + Prettier) for a combined workflow.

---

## Why It Matters

- Standardizes project setup and structure across all projects.
- Reduces repetitive tasks and accelerates development.
- Ensures consistency and compatibility of features and utilities.
