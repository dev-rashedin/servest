# Prisma Addon

The `Prisma` addon in **Servest** provides an easy way to integrate Prisma ORM into your backend project.  
It automates the setup of Prisma dependencies, configuration files, and environment variables to help you start working with databases faster.

---

## How It Works

When you run:

```bash
npx servest@latest add prisma
```

Servest will:

1. **Check the framework**  
   Ensures your project uses a supported Node.js framework before proceeding.

2. **Install Prisma dependencies**  
   Installs the required packages using your selected package manager (`npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, or `bun`).

   Packages installed (with versions):
   - `prisma@6.15.0` (as a dev dependency)
   - `@prisma/client@6.15.0` (as a runtime dependency)

3. **Generate Prisma configuration**  
   Creates the `prisma/schema.prisma` file with a default PostgreSQL setup:

   ```bash
   generator client {
     provider = "prisma-client-js"
   }

   datasource db {
     provider = "postgresql"
     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }
   ```

4. **Create environment file**  
   Adds a `.env` file with a placeholder database URL if it does not already exist:

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname"
   ```

5. **Add Prisma scripts to package.json**  
   Adds or preserves these helpful scripts for common Prisma commands:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "prisma:generate": "prisma generate",
     "prisma:migrate": "prisma migrate dev"
   }
   ```

---

## Example

After running the Prisma addon, your project structure may look like this:

```bash
prisma/
  schema.prisma
.env
package.json (with added Prisma scripts)
```

You can then run Prisma commands directly from your terminal:

```bash
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:migrate
```

---

## Notes

- The addon checks if Prisma or `@prisma/client` are already installed to avoid duplicate setups.
- It safely creates missing configuration or environment files without overwriting existing ones.
- Make sure your `.env` file contains a valid `DATABASE_URL` before running migrations.
- You can manually modify the provider (e.g., `mysql`, `sqlite`, `mongodb`) in `schema.prisma` as needed.

## Why Use Prisma?

- **Type-safe queries** → works seamlessly with TypeScript and autocompletes queries.
- **Cross-database support** → supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, and more.
- **Developer-friendly CLI** → provides powerful commands for migrations and schema management.
- **Auto-generated client** → reduces boilerplate code and increases development speed.
- **Integrated setup** → Servest automates everything, so you can focus on writing your app instead of setting up ORM files.
